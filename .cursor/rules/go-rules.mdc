# Go Language Guidelines
- Follow Standard Layout Conventions: Conform to canonical Go project layouts for consistency and easier onboarding.
- Embrace Go Idioms: Adhere to language idioms, such as returning errors as the last return value.
Provide Meaningful Error Context: Ensure error handling includes clear, contextual information to facilitate debugging.
- Leverage Interfaces: Use interfaces for dependency injection and to enhance testability.
- Simplify Concurrent Code: Keep concurrent operations straightforward and employ the context package to manage cancellations and deadlines.
- Proactively Address Race Conditions: Use appropriate concurrency primitives to detect and fix potential race conditions.
- Prefer the Standard Library: Utilize built-in libraries whenever possible to reduce dependencies.
- Use Pointers Judiciously: Be mindful of copying behavior and optimize performance by using pointers only when appropriate.
- Integrate Formatting and Linting Tools: Consider tools like `go fmt` and `golangci-lint` to enforce code quality and consistency.
- Document with GoDoc: Provide clear documentation for exported functions and types using GoDoc comments.
